Duolingo is known for delivering a lot of intentionally nonsensical or witty content as example sentences. There's even a Twitter account called [Shit Duolingo Says](https://twitter.com/shitduosays?lang=en). 

The value of these sentences for learning is a bit debatable.
On the one hand, they're funny, ergo memorable. On the other hand, some of them are things you'd never generally hear (like "My plant likes eating meat"), so it's arguably a waste of time. Me, I'll take the funny. Anyway, this is a brief catalogue of some gems I've come across, basically funny sentences with nice community responses.
