I think some folks wrongly assume there's one tool that will make them 
proficient in a language (eg Duolingo, or a language course),
but I think there isn't. Just _curiosity_.

E.g: I started learning German via [Nico's Weg](https://learngerman.dw.com/en/nicos-weg/c-36519789) on DW. Was fun, but I started wondering
if it was enough. 
Then I stumbled on threads like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/German/comments/ohgait/how_dodid_you_use_nicos_weg/) and realised my mistake.
Since then, I've used DW, Duolingo, Learn German with Anja (YouTube channel), 
and many other random blogs and videos.

This is if you're looking for _proficiency_, btw (the definition of which also varies by person). If you just need to know some basics, or you're learning for fun, one or two tools might suffice.
