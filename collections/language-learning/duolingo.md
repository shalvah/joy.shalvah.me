# Thoughts on Duolingo

Things I like:

- Like the use of repetition and small chunks
- like idea of learning through practice
- Neutral towards gamification. Can be useful.
- Dislike excessive gamification.
- Dislike excessive repetition. I get the point of learning by rote, but sometimes it's just tiresome.
- dislike lack of challenge. Some questions are repeated, which gives very little challenge. Suggestion: modify question a bit
- really dislike lack of in-depth "Tips".
- also, no explanation for seeming contradictions or overlaps (leise/ruhig, wirklich/gut, hat Hunger/hungrig, word order)
- hate hearts -

Learning a new language, and those English language classes so many moons ago are really coming in handy. Identifying sentence structure and understanding why something is x versus y. SVO, SVA, etc. It's not for everyone, but it does help me learn.
