All of my top shows are comedy-dramas, because I come to TV to laugh and forget about life's troubles.

- _Community_ â€” I don't normally use the "GOAT" label, but this show is definitely one. Insanely funny, brilliant, and self-referential. The Roxanne scene is one of the greatest in TV.
- _How I Met Your Mother_ â€” Either 2nd place, or tied with Community. The time premise is brilliant. The last season can suck a dick, though.
- _The Fresh Prince of Bel Air_ â€” A "hood classic". Unexpectedly funny. I liked how we grew up with the family, and the themes became more adult.
- _Superstore_ â€” It's got "heart". The superstore setting is used to perfection. 
- _Lucifer_ - "The devil in L.A.". Brilliant premise, well executed (although they lost their way later on).
- _The Good Place_ â€” Such a clever concept, and handled well (until season 3, where it stopped making sense because they were trying to draw it out).
- _Archer_ â€” I dislike the "Archer is a dick that gets away_ with anything" premise, but the show is definitely witty and genuinely hilarious. King of running gags.
- _Brooklyn 99_ â€” One of my first. Thanks to this show, I d_iscovered _Die Hard_ (one of the greatest movies ever) and The Lonely Island (one of favourite music groups).
- _Everybody Hates Chris_ â€” A black kid's life. So funny an_d relatable. After watching this show, I searched for "Terry Crews", and that's how I discovered B99.

### Non-comedy faves_
Technically, they're still comedies. But they're not always laugh-out-loud funny (although definitely amusing). The main reason I like them is the dramaâ€”they're grounded, lighthearted and relatable.

- _Easy_ â€” An anthology show. Love the many different scenarios. Felt like we were watching real people's lives with a funny twist. Wish it had more seasons.
- _Master of None_ - Same feels as Easy above, but not an anthology.
- _Hot Date_ - Actually really funny. The main characters are definitely crazy. ðŸ¤£
- _Workin' Moms_ â€” Love. This. Show. Anne and Kate are national treasures.
- _Kim's Convenience_ â€” A pleasant watch. Hard to not like this show.

### Honorable mentions
- _Modern Family_ â€” Also very funny, but not as consistent as my top ones. 
- _New Girl_ â€” Got super funny after the first two seasons (but then dipped in later ones ðŸ˜¢).
- _The Crew_ â€” Was skeptical at first, but it turned out to be pretty funny and with some heart.
- _The Upshaws_ â€” Also skeptical, but also eventually good. Another "hood" show. I liked that it took on "hard" scenarios (irresponsible dad with baby mama), but in a lighthearted way.
- _The Good Wife_ â€” Drama show, but really good drama. Probably one of the few drama shows I really enjoyed. _How To Get Away With Murder_ and _Suits_ started out good but went over the top in a few seasons.
- _Squid Game_ - Didn't think I'd like this, but I did. It was extremely thought-provoking, a really intense watch (made me emotional at points), while still being entertaining.
