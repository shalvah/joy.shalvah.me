### Likes
- Comedies
- 20-30 minute episodes
- Dramas that are based on (close to) realistic scenarios. It's a bit ironic because I use TV as an escape, but ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
- Workplace comedies
- Meta humour
- Lots of swearing
- Some emotional moments, when they're earned
- Some thought-provoking moments, again when earned

### Dislikes
- Manufactured conflict (especially based around people not communicating)
- Melodrama. Exaggerated scenarios or people acting irrationally.
- Romance. Romance on TV is unrealistic.
- Teen shows/movies. They're the bastions of melodrama.
- 1-hour episodes.
- Laugh tracks. But if the show is good enough, I can ignore them (eg HIMYM)
- Preachiness. I personally don't watch TV for the "message", but that doesn't mean you can't have one. But at least let it fit into the story.
- Movies over 2 hours. The only movie permitted to be 3 hours long is _Avengers: Endgame_ (and even then, I had to watch it in two sittings).
- Michael Bay-style movies. Flashiness over substance.
- Zack Snyder-style movies. [Spectacle ("epic moments") over substance](https://mobile.twitter.com/theshalvah/status/1266394558121771009).
