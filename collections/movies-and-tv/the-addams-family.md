Ah, The Addams Family! Netflix recommended it to me, and I insta-clicked because I loved the cartoons when I was younger. I did check reviews, though, and I knew it wasn't going to be a very good film, but it was good enough.

I spent like three days watching this because I kept googling other Addams Family stuff ("You raaaaang?", the theme song, etc)ü§£. Yes, I know I'm being a sucker for nostalgia, but I've always loved the Addams Family.

Anyway, as expected, the film wasn't great, but it wasn't bad either. Some nice gags. I liked some of the references in there (but some were just...there), like "I'm not locked in here with you, you're locked in here with me!". I didn't like the weird animation and the character design. Also didn't like the characterization at first (Gomex and Morticia, mostly), but I got used to it.

Wasn't sure what the movie wanted to be: it was a bit too gross to be a kids' film (in 2019, at least), but too simplistic to be an adults' film. Overall, though, it was pretty enjoyable (a cinema kind of movie), and now I'm going to hunt down and watch Addams Family Values.üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Also, can I say how AWESOME the music for this movie was? From the opening scene (Christina Aguilera), I was hooked. Loved how some of them were variations on the Addams theme.
